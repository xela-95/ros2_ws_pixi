# ROS2 playground

In this repo is stored a ROS2 workspace in which I reproduced the excercises contained in the tutorial [RoboticsBackEnd](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLSegLrePWgJudpPUof4-nVFHGkB62Izy).

Instead of installing ROS2 system-wide using APT I used pixi and the `robostack` channel to install all the dependencies I need in a pixi environment.
